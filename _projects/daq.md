title: Data Acquisition Unit (DAQ)
description: Software development for a DAQ System
---
This is an ongoing project where I am upgrading software for a USB Data Acquisition Device (DAQ). The software is being developed using C# language.
The DAQ unit is primarily intended for university students to learn the basics of host-to-device and device-to-host data communication via USB protocol. 
The DAQ device is currently being manufactured and sold as a lab instrument by Bibeat Ltd., a non-share holding company working to promote indigenously developed devices in collaboration with the dept. of Biomedical Physics & Technology, University of Dhaka.
