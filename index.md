Hello, World!

I’m Zihad Tarafdar, a Software Engineer who loves tinkering with tech. Whether it’s writing silly little Python scripts to add some spice to my daily tasks or fooling around with the latest GPT model fresh out of the never-ending AI landscape, I’m always in for experimenting with new tools. You could say I’m a jack of all trades, master of some!

Right now, I’m focused on developing AI tools and optimizing cloud infrastructure at Business Novelty Ltd.

Before this, I was part of a collaboration between the Department of Biomedical Physics & Technology at Dhaka University and Bibeat Ltd., where we worked on developing affordable healthcare solutions for low- and middle-income countries. I led the software development for homegrown medical devices and helped create a telemedicine platform that’s been recognized internationally.

I’ve always enjoyed combining tech with social impact, whether it's through developing web platforms or working on cool side projects. When I’m not coding, I’m usually exploring the latest in AI or cloud tech or playing Peekaboo with my pet birds, Totoro & Momo!
