Hello, there!
I am Zihad Tarafdar, currently working as a post-doctoral research fellow at the Dept. of Biomedical Physics & Technology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Throughout my doctoral and post-doctoral endeavors, I applied different modern web development tools and technologies, and designed, developed, and deployed web-based solutions for delivering primary health care to the rural population of Bangladesh through telemedicine. 
Additionally, I worked on developing device firmware and desktop-based applications as well as implementing USB interface protocols for acquiring, processing, and displaying data coming from different devices and cloud through REST API.
